#### Story

Hi, my name is Souk from Lyon, France.

I built Pomoto for my own personal usage and for my portfolio.
Every self-taught developer knows well how often we forget the time while coding.
You may already know the Pomodoro technique that helps you take a break every 25 minutes. It prevents you from deep-diving too long on a task.
There are so many Pomodoro apps around the web that I started to question how difficult it is to build. Then, I took it as a challenge.
