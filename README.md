#### Story

Hi, my name is Souk from Lyon, France.

I created Pomoto both for my personal use and as a valuable addition to my portfolio. As any self-taught developer understands, it's easy to lose track of time when immersed in coding. If you're familiar with the Pomodoro technique, which encourages short breaks every 25 minutes to avoid prolonged focus on a single task, you'll appreciate its effectiveness. With numerous Pomodoro apps available online, I began to ponder the challenge of creating one myself, and that's when I decided to take it on.
